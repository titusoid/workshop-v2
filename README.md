# Supply Chain Radar
A pure-frontend app that visualizes SBOM & vulnerability data generated by your CI.
- Dashboard with severity bars and package-type donut
- Searchable tables for CVEs and packages
- Data pulled from GitHub Pages at `/reports/grype.json` and `/reports/sbom.cdx.json`

## Quick start
```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```
Enable **GitHub Pages → Build and deployment → Source: GitHub Actions**.
Push to `main` and the `release-pages.yml` will build and publish.
Nightly monitor populates `reports/` with fresh data.
